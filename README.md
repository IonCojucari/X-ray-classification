# X-ray-classification
This project focuses on classifying chest X-ray images into Normal and Pneumonia categories using a deep learning model built with PyTorch. It includes image preprocessing, real-time predictions, and visualization of results. The model is trained on a Kaggle chest X-ray dataset and predicts with high accuracy, aiding in automated medical diagnosis.
